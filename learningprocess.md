## Learning How to Learn TED talk by Barbara Oakley

### Q3: Paraphrase the video in detail in your own words.

* she is explaining how to learn to get better at learning.

* She was in 10th grade moving all 10 different places. And learned new things.

* When she was in 3rd grade she showed interest in maths.

* Today she was a professor of engineering students, She is more passionate about her job.

* She doesn't have money to go to college after school, So she joined the army and learned a lot of things how through granade.

* In the army she has seen a lot of working maths and science to solve critical problems.

* She met her husband at the north pole and she learned Russian.

* She moved across the world to learn deeply.

* And she started research on neuroscience and psychology with top experts.

* She was out of the military at age of 26.

* Focus mode to learning.
    
    * When learning finds yourself focused and relaxed in neural states.

    * Try to solve new problems to know new things.
### What are some of the steps that you can take to improve your learning process?

* When we learn something to find ourselves be in focus mode and set all neural states.

* Whenever you are sitting to solve a new problem analyze the idea.

* When you started any task to do be focused on that, Don't leave.

* Using Promodoro Technique this technique works how, Take a timer set for 25 minutes on that and make sure everything is on silent mode. After that time focus only on the task and don't distract after the timeout take a break for a few minutes and then repeat the same thing. It will help after some days to focus on learning.

## Learn Anything in 20 hours

### Q5: Your key takeaways from the video? Paraphrase your understanding.

* What he was saying is he researched more on how much time takes to learn new things.

* He tried to read books in the library and saw some newspapers and articles to know.

* Then he found that when you want to learn anything new it will take 10,000 hours. It is almost 5 years.

* He wondered about how he invented something to learn quickly.

* He was saying by using some techniques we can learn any new thing in just 20 hours it might be daily 45 minutes for a month.

* He was explaining four techniques.

### Q6: What are some of the steps that you can while approaching a new topic?

* While approaching a new topic to learn we have to do the below steps.

    * Deconstructing the skill means breaking the content into as smaller parts as possible, learning important things first then trying to practice those things.

    * Learning enough to self-correct means first learning some parts and then practicing solving new problems on that know solutions on resources, Notifying your mistakes from that, and don't think to complete all the content at once and practice.

    * Remove Practice Barriers that means unnecessary like tv internet and mobile.

    * Practice at least 20 hours which means not a single time take daily 45minutes in a month.
