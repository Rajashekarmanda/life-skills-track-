# Tiny Habits

## Q1: Your takeaways from the video (Minimum 5 points)?
* He was obsessed with how behaviour works even on vacation, I'm thinking about behaviour, I'm watching the and, I'm reading stuff on it I'm trying to understand like some cases.
* Behavior change is not as complicated as most people think it's systemic and there are ways to understand but there are 15 ways behaviour can change.
* When you want to change long-term behaviour you can change your environment before. Motivation changes temporary behaviour but not long-term behaviour.
* We need to do our habits so of the 15 ways behaviours can change the one that matters most to long-term health care habits as we create these tiny habits.
* When you know how to create tiny habits, you can change your life forever. Cause behaviour three things motivation and ability to do and trigger the behaviour these three things together when they combine once and the behaviour will also change behaviour.

## Q2: Your takeaways from the video in as much detail as possible?
* Bj Fogg found formula B=MAP says if you habitat any habit in daily life it will change your life.
* Tiny habits have three parts first one is Shrink the behaviour and if the task is too high to do you should have motivation back there if it runs into the complete task.
* No matter what kind of change you want to make, matching yourself with the right behaviours is the key to changing your life for good. 
* For example, many people struggle to exercise, not because they don’t have enough time or money, say, but rather, because they’re not physically capable. If, however, they were to make the behaviour tiny, they would feel more capable of exercising. 


## Q3: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier?
* Bj Fogg found the formula for human behaviour B=MAP thus M means motivation and A means ability and P means prompt.
* This formula says if you read a book every night reading it if your motivation your energy to read matches the ability required to read the time it takes to hit your daily reading goal when the prompt to read is present then you see your book on a bed before you go to bed.
* Habits will change our daily life. The hack is called tiny habits. It has three parts. The first one is to Shrink the behaviour
* Most people wrongly assume that motivation is all you need to successfully build a new habit. Fogg disagrees, stating that motivation is only one part of the equation. And as we all know. motivation is unreliable. It doesn’t last forever.


## Q4: Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?
* Psychologist BJ Fogg is the founder and director of the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford University — he’s coached over 40,000 people in his behaviour change methods and influenced countless more. His Tiny Habits method states that a new behaviour happens when three elements come together: motivation, ability and a prompt.
* In working with thousands of people, Fogg has found one thing that helps fledgling habits to stick: Celebrating them. Here, he explains how the power of celebration can wire new behaviours into our lives
* I want to show you how to gain a superpower the ability to feel good at any given moment and use this superpower to transform your habits and, ultimately, your life
* Celebration is the best way to use emotions and create a positive feeling that wires in new habits. It’s free, fast, and available to people of every colour, shape, size, income and personality. In addition, celebration teaches us how to be nice to ourselves
Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
# Book Summary of Atomic Habits

## Q5: Your takeaways from the video (Minimum 5 points)?
* You're able to improve by one per cent each day for an entire year those games compound you would end up 37 times better at the end of the year.
* Good habits make time your ally bad habits make time your enemy.
* There are four stages of habit transformation. One thing doing and liking noticing.
* Stage one is noticing implementation intentions. the only reason that we repeat behaviours is that we enjoy them. After all, we like the reward. If we don’t enjoy the experience along the way, we’re unlikely to stick with it.
* Especially for habits, is that in the beginning, the most important thing. So the only reason that we repeat behaviours is that we enjoy them because we like the reward.

## Q6: Write about the book's perspective on habit formation from the lens of Identity, processes and outcomes.
* The key to building lasting habits is focusing on creating a new identity first. Your current behaviours are simply a reflection of your current identity. What you do now is a mirror image of the type of person you believe you are
* In my experience, when you want to become better at something, proving your identity to yourself is far more important than getting amazing results. This is especially true at first.
* Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe. When it comes to building habits that last when it comes to building a system of 1 per cent improvements the problem is not that one level is better or worse than another. All levels of change are useful in their way. The problem is the direction of change.
## Q7: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a good habit easier.

## Q8: Write about the book's perspective on making a bad habit more difficult.
* The most important part of building a new habit is staying consistent. It doesn’t matter how well you perform on any individual day. Sustained effort is what makes the real difference
* It’s easy to compare yourself to what others are doing or to feel the urge to optimize your performance and do more. Don’t let those feelings pull you off course. Prove to yourself that you can stick to something small for 30 days. Then, once you are on a roll and remaining consistent, you can worry about increasing the difficulty.
